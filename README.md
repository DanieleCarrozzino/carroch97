<h3>Android developer - Java, Kotlin</h3>

<b>This is the presentation of all my personal project</b>

In recent years I have worked as a mobile developer for a messaging and video conferencing company, 
in parallel with this career path I have enjoyed some personal projects of questionable seriousness and usefulness, 
to learn more my development environment.

The languages that I have used most in my professional path are: <b>Java, Kotlin, C++, xml</b>

<h1>Personal project</h1>

<h2>First project - Sprinkler!</h2>

<h4>Have you ever been on vacation for too long and all your plants have dried up when you return?</h4>

WELL! You need an <b>automatic sprinkler</b>

Uao! but wait, what is an Automatic sprinkler?

<h4>Project description</h4>

I started this project at the end of 2019 at the beginning of my work experience.
It was born from the idea of being able to have fun with a practical and usable implementation in the everyday routine.

<h4>Technical description</h4>

The project is divided into 2 parts, the hardware part and the application part.
I will not explain too much the hardware part also because it is not my field and I don't think it is too interesting for a mobile developer.

<h4>Hardware part</h4>
  Components used: <b>Arduino uno, humidity sensor, bluetooth module, small engine</b>
  
  ```
  TODO
  insert arduino code (maybe)
 
  ```
  
  <h4>Aplication part</h4>
  
  ```
  TODO
  Insert Bets code
  
  ```

<h2>Second project - Scraper</h2>

Born as a web scraper to get information on the covid in a single application, it has evolved as a notification manager.
